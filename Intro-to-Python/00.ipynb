    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures are using Jupyter Notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be run on a webserver or stand-alone on a computer."

    "### Loging into the web server\n",
    "The easiest way to run this and other notebooks for participants of EANBiT is to log into the Jupyter Server at [ICIPE](to be added). The steps for running notebooks are:\n",
    "* Log in using the username and passowrd provided\n",
    "* Press the start button (if prompted by the system)\n",
    "* Use the menu of the jupyter system to upload a .ipynb python notebook file or to start a new notebook.\n",

    "### Installing \n",
    "\n",
    "Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.continuum.io/downloads]. Make sure to get the Python *3.6* version, not 2.7. This distribution comes with the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook.\n",
